This is a solution to the [Multi-step form challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/multistep-form-YVAnSdqQBJ). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 


## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-only workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned
This was a tough challenge. Main objective was to use only vanilla Javascript since for the  last few projects I used mainly react, I wanted to refresh my Javascript memory. This project is not perfect copy of the provided challenge but it was a good practice.

### Continued development

In the future project I would like to write cleaner code and make it more simple. I think a good thing to do would also be to have few functions which cover most of functionality of the page. Nevertheless, it seems to me this project was really demanding and I had to dedicate quite some time to finish it.
